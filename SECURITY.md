## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security bugs in cleanup-cloudflare-deployments seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory [Report a Vulnerability](https://github.com/Th3S4mur41/cleanup-cloudflare-deployments/security/advisories/new) tab.

We will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, we will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.

Please do **not** disclose security issues publicly until they have been reviewed and patched.
